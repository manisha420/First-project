            "content": "<p>JUVIA is a liquid food supplement, available in 200ml bottles. <strong>JUVIA is designed to work with your gut flora to help break down carbohydrates<\/strong>, before they can trigger any digestive issues.<\/p>\n<p>JUVIA is plant-based, made with ERME™, which is derived from barley. Suitable for vegetarians and vegans. <strong>Contains gluten.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The product will come in a thick liquid form (similar in texture and taste to runny honey). You can take it on its own from a tablespoon, mixed in some water or any other cold drink, in your cereal, in a salad or any other cold food.<\/p>\n<b>How to take JUVIA:<\/b>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Rebalancing Phase (first 6 weeks)<\/strong>: Take 1.5 tablespoons (22ml) twice a day, immediately before or after meals (e.g. 1.5 tbsp with breakfast and 1.5 tbsp with dinner).<\/li>\n<li>\n<strong>Maintenance Phase (6 weeks +)<\/strong>: Reduce to one 15ml tablespoon per day, immediately before or after your main meal.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It’s important to note that everyone is different, and you may find that you’re more comfortable continuing the Rebalancing Phase.<\/p>\n<p>JUVIA is not suitable for children under 5. Children aged 5-12 should take half the recommended daily dose (11ml twice a day in the Rebalancing Phase, and 7.5ml once per day during the Maintenance Phase).<\/p><p><\/p>\n<ul class=\"tab_li\">\n<strong><li>Free delivery<\/li>\n<u><li><a href=\"https:\/\/juvia.me\/pages\/refund-policy\" title=\"30 day money back guarantee\" style=\"color: white\">30-day money-back guarantee<\/a><\/li><\/u>\n<li>Free app to track your progress<\/li>\n<li>Easy daily routine<\/li><\/strong>\n<\/ul>",
